### Basic concepts

#### What is a Web Server?
A web server is a software application that serves content to clients over the internet or an intranet using the HTTP protocol. It processes incoming requests from clients, retrieves the requested resources, and sends them back as responses. Web servers can serve static content like HTML, CSS, and images, as well as dynamic content generated by applications running on the server.

- [Coding a Web Server in 25 Lines - Computerphile](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7GBlCinu9yg)

#### Endianness
Endianness refers to the order in which bytes are stored in memory. There are two main types of endianness: big-endian and little-endian. Web servers and clients must agree on the endianness to correctly interpret data sent over the network.

![little-big-endian](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/3257c5e5-403d-47db-9bc2-f0ccdb79846e)

- **Big-endian**: Most significant byte is stored at the lowest memory address.
- **Little-endian**: Least significant byte is stored at the lowest memory address.

### TCP/IP Protocol Suite

The TCP/IP protocol suite is a set of communication protocols used to connect devices over the internet. It consists of several layers, each responsible for different aspects of network communication.

- **IP (Internet Protocol)**:

	![ip](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/f9a63716-3a70-494a-9926-cbdeab056f76)

	- An IP address is a unique identifier for a device on a network.
	- IPv4 addresses are 32-bit numbers usually represented in dotted-decimal format (e.g., 192.168.1.1).
	- IPv6 addresses are 128-bit numbers represented in hexadecimal (e.g., 2001:0db8:85a3:0000:0000:8a2e:0370:7334).
- **TCP (Transmission Control Protocol)**:

	![tcp-1](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/f37c6f88-a2e9-406c-a358-d211d0022e8d)

	- A connection-oriented protocol that provides reliable, ordered, and error-checked delivery of a stream of bytes.
	- **Three-way handshake**:
		1. Client sends a SYN packet to the server.
		2. Server sends a SYN-ACK packet to the client.
		3. Client sends an ACK packet to the server.
	- **Four-way handshake**:
		1. Client sends a FIN packet to the server.
		2. Server sends an ACK packet to the client.
		3. Server sends a FIN packet to the client.
		4. Client sends an ACK packet to the server.

- **UDP (User Datagram Protocol)**:
	- A connectionless protocol that provides unreliable, unordered, and error-checked delivery of a stream of bytes.
	- **Connectionless**: No connection is established before data is sent.
	- **Unreliable**: No guarantee that data will be delivered.
	- **Unordered**: No guarantee that data will be received in the order it was sent.

- **Ports**:
	- A port is a communication endpoint that identifies a specific process or service on a host.
	- Ports are identified by a 16-bit number ranging from 0 to 65535.
	- **Well-known ports**:
		- Ports ranging from 0 to 1023 are reserved for system services.
	- **Registered ports**:
		- Ports ranging from 1024 to 49151 are registered with the IANA.
	- **Dynamic ports**:
		- Ports ranging from 49152 to 65535 are used for private or temporary purposes.

- **Socket**:

	![sockets](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/5e79d8ba-469a-489b-b4cf-9eb9ba762fa4)

	- A socket is an endpoint for communication between two machines.
	- A socket is identified by an IP address and a port number.
	- **Server socket**:
		- A server socket listens for incoming connections.
	- **Client socket**:
		- A client socket initiates a connection to a server socket.

### Socket Programming

Socket programming is a way of connecting two nodes on a network to communicate with each other. One socket listens on a particular port at an IP, while the other socket reaches out to the other to form a connection.

- **Server-Client Model**:
	- A server is a program that listens for incoming connections.
	- A client is a program that initiates a connection to a server.
- **Socket**:
	- A socket is an endpoint for communication between two machines.
	- A socket is identified by an IP address and a port number.
	- **Server socket**:
		- A server socket listens for incoming connections.
	- **Client socket**:
		- A client socket initiates a connection to a server socket.

### Non-blocking I/O and Multiplexing

Non-blocking I/O and multiplexing are techniques used to handle multiple I/O operations simultaneously without blocking the execution of the program.

- **Non-blocking I/O**:
	- **Blocking I/O**: The process waits until the I/O operation is complete.
	- **Non-blocking I/O**:
		- The process continues executing while the I/O operation is in progress.
			```c
			fcntl(sockfd, F_SETFL, O_NONBLOCK);

			// fcntl(): Performs operations on file descriptors.
			```

### HTTP Protocol

The Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP) is an application-layer protocol used for transmitting hypermedia documents, such as HTML files, over the internet. It is the foundation of data communication on the World Wide Web.

	- **Caching**: Allows the client to store a copy of the response for future use.
	- **Compression**: Allows the server to compress the response before sending it to the client.
	- **Authentication**: Allows the server to require user authentication.
	- **Cookies**: Allows the server to store information on the client's computer.
