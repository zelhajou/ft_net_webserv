</details>

<details>
<summary><b>Tasks for Network Infrastructure and Server Setup</b></summary>

<details>
<summary><b>Task 1: Setup Basic Server Framework</b></summary>

**Objective**: Establish a basic server framework that can handle TCP connections.

**Steps:**

1. **Creating Main Entry Point:**
    - Developing `main.cpp`, which includes the main function where the server starts executing.
    - Setting up basic command line parsing to read arguments like configuration file paths or port numbers.

2. **Initializing Server Class:**
    - Designing a `Server` class that encapsulates all server-related functionalities.
    - Implementing constructors and destructors, considering resource management for network connections.
</details>

<details>
<summary><b>Task 2: Implementing Socket Programming</b></summary>

**Objective**: Develop the socket programming foundation that will allow the server to accept and manage client connections.

**Steps:**

1. **Socket Creation:**
    - Using the `socket()` system call to create a socket that listens for incoming connections.
    - Ensuring that the socket is set to the Internet domain (AF_INET) and uses TCP (SOCK_STREAM).

2. **Binding Socket:**
    - Binding the socket to an IP address and port. Typically, servers bind to `INADDR_ANY` to accept connections on any interface and a specific port from the server configuration.
    - Handling potential errors in binding, such as "Address already in use," with appropriate error messages and retries if necessary.

3. **Listening on Socket:**
    - Setting the socket to listen for incoming connections with `listen()`.
    - Defining the backlog queue length, which determines how many pending connections can queue up.
</details>

<details>
<summary><b>Task 3: Accepting and Managing Connections</b></summary>

**Objective**: Efficiently accept incoming client connections and manage these using either blocking or non-blocking sockets.

**Steps:**

1. **Accepting Connections:**
    - Continuously checking for incoming connections using `accept()`, which will block until a new connection is made unless non-blocking sockets are used.
    - For each accepted connection, possibly spawning a new thread or delegating to a worker depending on the concurrency model chosen (e.g., multi-threading, event-driven).

2. **Non-Blocking I/O:**
    - Setting sockets to non-blocking mode using `fcntl()` to prevent the server from being stalled by I/O operations.
    - This is essential for implementing an event-driven model that uses `select()`, `poll()`, or `epoll()` to handle multiple connections efficiently.
</details>

<details>
<summary><b>Task 4: Using Multiplexing for Handling Connections</b></summary>

**Objective**: Implement I/O multiplexing to handle multiple connections simultaneously without using multiple threads for each connection.

**Steps:**

1. **Select Implementation:**
    - Implementing `select()` as the starting point for multiplexing, which monitors multiple file descriptors to see if any of them are ready for reading or writing.
    - Setting up `fd_set` for read and write descriptors and using `select()` to determine which sockets can perform non-blocking read or write operations.

2. **Advanced Multiplexing (Optional):**
    - If performance under `select()` is limiting, considering using more scalable methods like `epoll()` on Linux or `kqueue()` on BSD systems, which handle large numbers of simultaneous connections more efficiently.
    - Implementing these systems in a modular way so that the underlying multiplexing mechanism can be switched based on the deployment environment or configuration settings.
</details>

<details>
<summary><b>Task 5: Testing and Validation</b></summary>

**Objective**: Ensure the network infrastructure is robust and can handle various network conditions.

**Steps:**

1. **Unit Testing:**
    - Writing unit tests for each component (socket creation, binding, listening, accepting).
    - Testing error handling and edge cases, such as what happens if the server runs out of available ports or the maximum number of connections is reached.

2. **Integration Testing:**
    - Testing the server with simulated client connections.
    - Using tools like `telnet` or `nc` (Netcat) to connect to the server and send requests.

3. **Stress Testing:**
    - Using a tool like `siege` or `ab` (Apache Bench) to stress test the server with a large number of concurrent connections.

## Topics

### Basic concepts

#### What is a Web Server?
A web server is a software application that serves content to clients over the internet or an intranet using the HTTP protocol. It processes incoming requests from clients, retrieves the requested resources, and sends them back as responses. Web servers can serve static content like HTML, CSS, and images, as well as dynamic content generated by applications running on the server.

- [Coding a Web Server in 25 Lines - Computerphile](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7GBlCinu9yg)

#### Endianness
Endianness refers to the order in which bytes are stored in memory. There are two main types of endianness: big-endian and little-endian. Web servers and clients must agree on the endianness to correctly interpret data sent over the network.

![little-big-endian](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/3257c5e5-403d-47db-9bc2-f0ccdb79846e)

- **Big-endian**: Most significant byte is stored at the lowest memory address.
- **Little-endian**: Least significant byte is stored at the lowest memory address.

### TCP/IP Protocol Suite

The TCP/IP protocol suite is a set of communication protocols used to connect devices over the internet. It consists of several layers, each responsible for different aspects of network communication.

- **IP (Internet Protocol)**:

	![ip](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/f9a63716-3a70-494a-9926-cbdeab056f76)

	- An IP address is a unique identifier for a device on a network.
	- IPv4 addresses are 32-bit numbers usually represented in dotted-decimal format (e.g., 192.168.1.1).
	- IPv6 addresses are 128-bit numbers represented in hexadecimal (e.g., 2001:0db8:85a3:0000:0000:8a2e:0370:7334).
- **TCP (Transmission Control Protocol)**:

	![tcp-1](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/f37c6f88-a2e9-406c-a358-d211d0022e8d)

	- A connection-oriented protocol that provides reliable, ordered, and error-checked delivery of a stream of bytes.
	- **Three-way handshake**:
		1. Client sends a SYN packet to the server.
		2. Server sends a SYN-ACK packet to the client.
		3. Client sends an ACK packet to the server.
	- **Four-way handshake**:
		1. Client sends a FIN packet to the server.
		2. Server sends an ACK packet to the client.
		3. Server sends a FIN packet to the client.
		4. Client sends an ACK packet to the server.

- **UDP (User Datagram Protocol)**:
	- A connectionless protocol that provides unreliable, unordered, and error-checked delivery of a stream of bytes.
	- **Connectionless**: No connection is established before data is sent.
	- **Unreliable**: No guarantee that data will be delivered.
	- **Unordered**: No guarantee that data will be received in the order it was sent.

- **Ports**:
	- A port is a communication endpoint that identifies a specific process or service on a host.
	- Ports are identified by a 16-bit number ranging from 0 to 65535.
	- **Well-known ports**:
		- Ports ranging from 0 to 1023 are reserved for system services.
	- **Registered ports**:
		- Ports ranging from 1024 to 49151 are registered with the IANA.
	- **Dynamic ports**:
		- Ports ranging from 49152 to 65535 are used for private or temporary purposes.

- **Socket**:

	![sockets](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/5e79d8ba-469a-489b-b4cf-9eb9ba762fa4)

	- A socket is an endpoint for communication between two machines.
	- A socket is identified by an IP address and a port number.
	- **Server socket**:
		- A server socket listens for incoming connections.
	- **Client socket**:
		- A client socket initiates a connection to a server socket.

### Socket Programming

Socket programming is a way of connecting two nodes on a network to communicate with each other. One socket listens on a particular port at an IP, while the other socket reaches out to the other to form a connection.

- **Server-Client Model**:
	- A server is a program that listens for incoming connections.
	- A client is a program that initiates a connection to a server.
- **Socket**:
	- A socket is an endpoint for communication between two machines.
	- A socket is identified by an IP address and a port number.
	- **Server socket**:
		- A server socket listens for incoming connections.

### Non-blocking I/O and Multiplexing

Non-blocking I/O and multiplexing are techniques used to handle multiple I/O operations simultaneously without blocking the execution of the program.

- **Non-blocking I/O**:
	- **Blocking I/O**: The process waits until the I/O operation is complete.
	- **Non-blocking I/O**:
		- The process continues executing while the I/O operation is in progress.
			```c
			fcntl(sockfd, F_SETFL, O_NONBLOCK);

			// fcntl(): Performs operations on file descriptors.
			```
	- **Multiplexing**:
 		- <details>
			<summary>
				select():
			</summary>
			
			- Monitors multiple file descriptors for I/O readiness.
			- **Read Set**: Contains file descriptors that are ready for reading.
			- **Write Set**: Contains file descriptors that are ready for writing.
			- **Error Set**: Contains file descriptors that have errors.

- **HTTP/1.1**:
	- **Persistent Connections**: Allows multiple requests and responses to be sent over a single connection.
	- **Pipelining**: Allows multiple requests to be sent without waiting for the responses.
	- **Chunked Transfer Encoding**: Allows data to be sent in chunks.
	- **Content Negotiation**: Allows the server to send different content based on the client's preferences.
	- **Caching**: Allows the client to store a copy of the response for future use.
	- **Compression**: Allows the server to compress the response before sending it to the client.
	- **Authentication**: Allows the server to require user authentication.
	- **Cookies**: Allows the server to store information on the client's computer.
	- **Redirects**: Allows the server to redirect the client to a different URL.
	- **Error Handling**: Allows the server to send error messages to the client.
	- **Security**: Allows the server to enforce security policies.
