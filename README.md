## Network Infrastructure and Server Setup

<details>

<summary>

<h3>Task 1: Setup Basic Server Framework</h3>

</summary>

**Objective**: Establish a basic server framework that can handle TCP connections.

**Step:**

1. **Create Main Entry Point:**
	- Develop `main.cpp`, which includes the main function where the server starts executing.
	- Set up basic command line parsing to read arguments like configuration file paths or port numbers.

2. **Initialize Server Class:**
	- Design a `Server` class that encapsulates all server-related functionalities.
	- Implement constructors and destructors, considering resource management for network connections.

</details>


<details>

<summary>

<h3>Task 2: Implement Socket Programming</h3>

</summary>

**Objective**: Develop the socket programming foundation that will allow the server to accept and manage client connections.

**Steps**:

1. **Socket Creation:**
	- Use the `socket()` system call to create a socket that listens for incoming connections.
	- Ensure that the socket is set to the Internet domain (AF_INET) and uses TCP (SOCK_STREAM).

2. **Binding Socket**:

- Bind the socket to an IP address and port. Typically, servers bind to `INADDR_ANY` to accept connections on any interface and a specific port from the server configuration.
- Handle potential errors in binding, such as "Address already in use," with appropriate error messages and retries if necessary.

3. **Listening on Socket:**
	- Set the socket to listen for incoming connections with `listen()`.
	- Define the backlog queue length, which determines how many pending connections can queue up.

</details>


<details>

<summary>

<h3>Task 3: Accept and Manage Connections</h3>

</summary>


**Objective**: Efficiently accept incoming client connections and manage these using either blocking or non-blocking sockets.

**Steps**:
1. **Accepting Connections**:

	- Continuously check for incoming connections using `accept()`, which will block until a new connection is made unless non-blocking sockets are used.
	- For each accepted connection, possibly spawn a new thread or delegate to a worker depending on the concurrency model chosen (e.g., multi-threading, event-driven).

2. **Non-Blocking I/O:**
	- Set sockets to non-blocking mode using `fcntl()` to prevent the server from being stalled by I/O operations.
	- This is essential for implementing an event-driven model that uses `select()`, `poll()`, or `epoll()` to handle multiple connections efficiently.

</details>



<details>

<summary>

<h3>Task 4: Use of Multiplexing for Handling Connections</h3>

</summary>

**Objective**: Implement I/O multiplexing to handle multiple connections simultaneously without using multiple threads for each connection.

**Steps**:

1. **Select Implementation**:

	- Implement `select()` as the starting point for multiplexing, which monitors multiple file descriptors to see if any of them are ready for reading or writing.
	- Setup `fd_set` for read and write descriptors and use `select()` to determine which sockets can perform non-blocking read or write operations.

2. **Advanced Multiplexing (Optional)**:

	- If performance under `select()` is limiting, consider using more scalable methods like `epoll()` on Linux or `kqueue()` on BSD systems, which handle large numbers of simultaneous connections more efficiently.
	- Implement these systems in a modular way so that the underlying multiplexing mechanism can be switched based on the deployment environment or configuration settings.

</details>


<details>

<summary>

<h3>Testing and Validation</h3>

</summary>

**Objective**: Ensure the network infrastructure is robust and can handle various network conditions.

**Steps**:

1. **Unit Testing**:
	- Write unit tests for each component (socket creation, binding, listening, accepting).
	- Test error handling and edge cases, such as what happens if the server runs out of available ports or the maximum number of connections is reached.
2. **Integration Testing**:
	- Test the server with simulated client connections.
	- Use tools like `telnet` or `nc` (Netcat) to connect to the server and send requests.
3. **Stress Testing**:
	- Use a tool like `siege` or `ab` (Apache Bench) to stress test the server with a large number of concurrent connections. 

</details>

**Requirements from Subject**

- Must not crash under any circumstances.
- Must handle configuration files.
- Must be non-blocking and use one poll() (or equivalent) for all I/O operations.
- Ensure resilience and continuous availability under stress tests.



## HTTP Protocol Handling

**Steps**:

1. **Understanding HTTP Request Structure**:
	- Familiarize with the structure of an HTTP request, which consists of a request line, headers, and an optional body.
	- The request line includes the method (GET, POST, etc.), URI, and HTTP version.

2. **Implement Request Parser**:
	- Create a class `HTTPRequest` that contains properties for method, URI, headers, version, and body.
	- Implement the parsing logic that reads the incoming request data and populates the `HTTPRequest` object.
	- Handle different types of HTTP headers and manage content-length for handling the body of POST requests.

3. **Error Handling in Parsing**:
	- Implement error checking during parsing to handle malformed requests.
	- Generate appropriate error responses for bad requests, such as `400 Bad Request`.
</details>


<details>

<summary>

<h3>Task 2: Implement HTTP Response Generation</h3>

</summary>

**Objective**: Construct HTTP responses based on the server's handling of the request, including generating headers and the appropriate body content.

**Steps**:

1. **Design Response Generator**:
	- Create a class `HTTPResponse` that includes properties for the status code, headers, and body.
	- Implement methods to easily add headers, set the status code, and append data to the body.

2. **Generating Responses**:
	- Based on the parsed request and server logic (e.g., fetching a static file or handling a form submission), fill the `HTTPResponse` object.
	- Ensure proper HTTP status codes are used (e.g., 200 OK, 404 Not Found).

3. **Content-Type Handling**:
	- Implement a mechanism to correctly identify and set the `Content-Type` header based on the file requested or data being served.

</details>


<details>

<summary>

<h3>Task 3: Serve Static Content</h3>

</summary>


**Objective**: Handle requests for static files like HTML, CSS, and images stored in the server's file system.

**Steps**:

1. **File System Access**:
	- Implement file reading capabilities that allow the server to fetch and serve files located in the server's document root or specified directories.
	- Handle file not found or access errors by responding with `404 Not Found` or` 403 Forbidden`.
2. **MIME Types**:
	- Set up a MIME type dictionary that maps file extensions to their corresponding MIME types, ensuring that the server responds with the correct `Content-Type`.
	- Use this dictionary when constructing the headers for static content responses.

</details>

<details>

<summary>

<h3>Task 4: Implement Support for Different HTTP Methods</h3>

</summary>

**Objective**: Support multiple HTTP methods, initially focusing on GET, POST, and DELETE.

**Steps**:

1. **GET Method**:
	- Implement handling for GET requests where the server returns the requested resource or a 404 if not found.

2. **POST Method**:
	- Handle POST requests, typically used for submitting forms. Process the data sent in the request body and possibly store it or respond based on the input.

3. **DELETE Method**:
	- Implement DELETE requests that allow clients to request the deletion of a resource. Ensure proper permissions and conditions are checked before deletion.
</details>


<details>

<summary>

<h3>Testing and Validation</h3>

</summary>

**Objective**: Ensure the HTTP handling components function correctly and robustly across a range of expected and edge-case scenarios.

**Steps**:

1. **Unit Testing**:
	- Write comprehensive unit tests for each part of the HTTP handling, including request parsing, response generation, and method handling.
2. **Integration Testing**:
	- Test the integration of HTTP handling with the networking code to ensure that requests are correctly received, processed, and responded to.
3. **Functional Testing**:
	- Use tools like Postman or curl to test the server’s response to various HTTP requests, checking for correctness in headers, status codes, and body content.

**Steps**:

1. **Understanding Configuration Requirements**:
	- Determine which server aspects should be configurable, including IP binding, port numbers, document root, default error pages, and security settings like maximum allowed connections and timeouts.
2. **Configuration File Format**:
	- Decide on a configuration file format like Nginx’s `nginx.conf`
3. **Implement Configuration Parser**:
	- Create a `ConfigParser` class that reads and parses the configuration file.
	- Use standard file I/O to read the configuration file and parse it into a structured format that the server can use.
	- Validate configuration values and provide defaults where necessary.

4. **Apply Configuration**:
	- Integrate the configuration settings into the server’s startup sequence.
	- Ensure that the server behaves according to the settings specified in the configuration file, such as starting on the correct port and serving files from the specified document root.

**Networking Basics**:

1. **TCP/IP Protocol Suite**: A set of protocols that allows two or more devices to communicate over a network.

	- **IP (Internet Protocol)**:
		- An IP address is a unique identifier for a device on a network.
		- IPv4 addresses are 32-bit numbers usually represented in dotted-decimal format (e.g., 192.168.1.1).
		- IPv6 addresses are 128-bit numbers represented in hexadecimal (e.g., 2001:0db8:85a3:0000:0000:8a2e:0370:7334).
	- **TCP (Transmission Control Protocol)**:
		- A connection-oriented protocol that provides reliable, ordered, and error-checked delivery of a stream of bytes.
		- **Three-way handshake**:
			1. Client sends a SYN packet to the server.
			2. Server sends a SYN-ACK packet to the client.
			3. Client sends an ACK packet to the server.
		- **Four-way handshake**:
			1. Client sends a FIN packet to the server.
			2. Server sends an ACK packet to the client.
			3. Server sends a FIN packet to the client.
			4. Client sends an ACK packet to the server.
	- **UDP (User Datagram Protocol)**:
		- A connectionless protocol that provides unreliable, unordered, and error-checked delivery of a stream of bytes.
		- **Connectionless**: No connection is established before data is sent.
		- **Unreliable**: No guarantee that data will be delivered.
		- **Unordered**: No guarantee that data will be received in the order it was sent.
	- **Ports**:
		- A port is a communication endpoint that identifies a specific process or service on a host.
		- Ports are identified by a 16-bit number ranging from 0 to 65535.
		- **Well-known ports**:
			- Ports ranging from 0 to 1023 are reserved for system services.
		- **Registered ports**:
			- Ports ranging from 1024 to 49151 are registered with the IANA.
		- **Dynamic ports**:
			- Ports ranging from 49152 to 65535 are used for private or temporary purposes.
	- **Socket**:
		- A socket is an endpoint for communication between two machines.
		- A socket is identified by an IP address and a port number.
		- **Server socket**:
			- A server socket listens for incoming connections.
		- **Client socket**:
			- A client socket initiates a connection to a server socket.
