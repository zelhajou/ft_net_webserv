</details>

<details>
<summary><b>Tasks for Network Infrastructure and Server Setup</b></summary>

<details>
<summary><b>Task 1: Setup Basic Server Framework</b></summary>

**Objective**: Establish a basic server framework that can handle TCP connections.

**Steps:**

1. **Creating Main Entry Point:**
    - Developing `main.cpp`, which includes the main function where the server starts executing.
    - Setting up basic command line parsing to read arguments like configuration file paths or port numbers.

2. **Initializing Server Class:**
    - Designing a `Server` class that encapsulates all server-related functionalities.
    - Implementing constructors and destructors, considering resource management for network connections.
</details>

<details>
<summary><b>Task 2: Implementing Socket Programming</b></summary>

**Objective**: Develop the socket programming foundation that will allow the server to accept and manage client connections.

**Steps:**

1. **Socket Creation:**
    - Using the `socket()` system call to create a socket that listens for incoming connections.
    - Ensuring that the socket is set to the Internet domain (AF_INET) and uses TCP (SOCK_STREAM).

2. **Binding Socket:**
    - Binding the socket to an IP address and port. Typically, servers bind to `INADDR_ANY` to accept connections on any interface and a specific port from the server configuration.
    - Handling potential errors in binding, such as "Address already in use," with appropriate error messages and retries if necessary.

3. **Listening on Socket:**
    - Setting the socket to listen for incoming connections with `listen()`.
    - Defining the backlog queue length, which determines how many pending connections can queue up.
</details>

<details>
<summary><b>Task 3: Accepting and Managing Connections</b></summary>

**Objective**: Efficiently accept incoming client connections and manage these using either blocking or non-blocking sockets.

**Steps:**

1. **Accepting Connections:**
    - Continuously checking for incoming connections using `accept()`, which will block until a new connection is made unless non-blocking sockets are used.
    - For each accepted connection, possibly spawning a new thread or delegating to a worker depending on the concurrency model chosen (e.g., multi-threading, event-driven).

2. **Non-Blocking I/O:**
    - Setting sockets to non-blocking mode using `fcntl()` to prevent the server from being stalled by I/O operations.
    - This is essential for implementing an event-driven model that uses `select()`, `poll()`, or `epoll()` to handle multiple connections efficiently.
</details>

<details>
<summary><b>Task 4: Using Multiplexing for Handling Connections</b></summary>

**Objective**: Implement I/O multiplexing to handle multiple connections simultaneously without using multiple threads for each connection.

**Steps:**

1. **Select Implementation:**
    - Implementing `select()` as the starting point for multiplexing, which monitors multiple file descriptors to see if any of them are ready for reading or writing.
    - Setting up `fd_set` for read and write descriptors and using `select()` to determine which sockets can perform non-blocking read or write operations.

2. **Advanced Multiplexing (Optional):**
    - If performance under `select()` is limiting, considering using more scalable methods like `epoll()` on Linux or `kqueue()` on BSD systems, which handle large numbers of simultaneous connections more efficiently.
    - Implementing these systems in a modular way so that the underlying multiplexing mechanism can be switched based on the deployment environment or configuration settings.
</details>

<details>
<summary><b>Task 5: Testing and Validation</b></summary>

**Objective**: Ensure the network infrastructure is robust and can handle various network conditions.

**Steps:**

1. **Unit Testing:**
    - Writing unit tests for each component (socket creation, binding, listening, accepting).
    - Testing error handling and edge cases, such as what happens if the server runs out of available ports or the maximum number of connections is reached.

2. **Integration Testing:**
    - Testing the server with simulated client connections.
    - Using tools like `telnet` or `nc` (Netcat) to connect to the server and send requests.

3. **Stress Testing:**
    - Using a tool like `siege` or `ab` (Apache Bench) to stress test the server with a large number of concurrent connections.
